- 👋 Hey, I’m @Zofimp
- 👀 I’m interested in game design, anarchism, coding sometimes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to skateboard
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool projects I'm interested in and that I can help with
- 📫 How to reach me: look up one of my social medias, I use the same nicknames pretty much everywhere
- 😄 Pronouns: I prefer feminine or neutral pronouns but I don't mind any
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you're not normal about trans people, I won't be normal to you. Honestly, sucks that's something that has to be said
